DISCLAIMER:
The program is not perfect. You will notice that tf_idf score picks up a lot of
non-food items and sometimes it picks up the correct items.You will notice it both
in the TESTS.txt and in your own testing. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
In order to the run file, the following command must be provided:

          python recipe_finder.py (filename.txt/filename.mmf)

This will import the file into the program and extract the data as needed.

I have provided the text or mmf files used to run with (tm) v8.05 version which were
found from this website: http://www.ffts.com/recipes.htm 


FOR TESTING
Note: I used 5 files from the Gemini and Leo Collection of MM Recipes collection.
Any recipe that contains:"MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.05" version
can be used,but  anything other than that will not work for the program without
having to update the code. Just in case I will provide multiple files in addition 
to what I used to test the program.
