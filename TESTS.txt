            and cut into 1  pieces
      1    red pepper  seeded and cut
            into 1 4  x 1  pieces
      1    red onion  chopped
    1 2 c  raspberry vinegar
    1 2 c  water
      1 tb sugar or honey
      1 ts parsley

  steam the asparagus pieces for 2 minutes   plunge into cold water to
  stop cooking   drain

  put asparagus  red pepper and onion into a plastic bowl  with cover
  blend vinegar  water  sugar  honey  and parsley in a separate bowl
  and then pour over vegetables  adjust seasonings if desired  may want
  to add more sweetness    stir  cover and refrigerate for at least 24
  hours  stir every so often

  serve cold as a side salad

  hint   make sure you only use the tender part of the asparagus  my mom
  taught me that you hold the tip and base of the asparagus in separate
  hands and then bend it until it breaks  only use the tip end and use
  the base end for soup or compost it
